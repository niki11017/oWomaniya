## About oWomaniya

Detection at early stage and treatment is necessary to avoid it.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a health problem that affects 1 in 10 women of childbearing age. In one study, up to 70 percent of women with PCOS hadnâ€™t been diagnosed.On average, 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetimes. About two-thirds of women with breast cancer are 55 or older. Most of the rest are between 35 and 54.Women generally fail to acknowledge early symptoms due to lack of awareness,due to which there are rise these conditions.Hence we need an application that reminds you for routine checkups and if the condition is serious then nearby doctors can be approached.
